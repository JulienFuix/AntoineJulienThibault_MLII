# Exercise 2: Meteorological Data - Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization
## Objective:
### In this exercise, we aim to perform dimensionality reduction on meteorological data collected from sensors to enable prediction of weather patterns.

# Implementation:

## Data Preparation:

Load the raw data and corresponding labels (indicating the presence or absence of a tempest) from provided files.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:

We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction.
We reduce the data to both 2 and 3 dimensions using each technique.

## Visualization:

Scatter plots are generated to visualize the reduced data points.
Data points are colored according to their corresponding labels to observe the separation of different classes.
Analysis:

We observe which dimensionality reduction technique (2D or 3D) provides better separation of data points based on their labels, aiding in predicting weather patterns.

## Conclusion:

Through this exercise, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize high-dimensional meteorological data in lower dimensions, facilitating better understanding and prediction of weather patterns. The choice between 2D and 3D reduction depends on which provides better separation of data points based on their labels, aiding in prediction tasks.
